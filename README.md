Description:
My term project is a 2D top-down shooter titled Cleanse the Deep,
where the player is put into a square map and is trying to get from
their start position to the end goal. Challenging the player are
maze-like generated walls, where some are destructible, and
enemies that are tasked with chasing and damaging the player. Get
to the lowest depths and attain the highest score!
